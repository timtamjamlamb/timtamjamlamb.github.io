      <description>Hi! My name is Jordan. I am a student in my penultimate year of study for a degree in Data Science at the University of Auckland.
I have always been passionate about computers, Statistics and technology as a whole. The thrill of understanding the insights of data and watching it work is something I’ve always been a fan of.
This website is supposed to be a portfolio for all my work and will be updated as I progress in my career.</description>

      <description>After entering the last competition I felt joining another. This was a dataset on the survival of passengers on the Titanic. This was a classification investigation and that is something I have little experience in Machine Learning.
There was more data visualisation whilst comparing the factors and their survival.
The model building was a more simple than the house regression and I ended up with a prediction that was very weak in terms of guessing the survival of the passengers.</description>

      <title>House Regression</title>

      <description>I have entered a Kaggle competition using the machine learning skills from a course I have taken earlier in the year. This was challenging as I have not used Kaggle or Anaconda as of late but I had a great time investigating the dataset.
The model building was a new experience but I have experience with regression from school and I ended up submitting an ensemble with the top three scores from R^2, RMSE and Cross validation.</description>

      <description>Hugo has figure shortcode built in, so you can easily add figcaptions or hyperlink rel attributes to images. Documentations can be found here:
https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure
This theme has 3 CSS classes made for figure elements:
 big: images will break the width limit of main content area. left: images will float to the left. right: images will float to the right.  If a figure has no class set, the image will behave just like a normal markdown image: !</description>

      <description>Just define the image URL in the content’s front matter, the featured image will be displayed as the background.
For example:
---images:- https://picsum.photos/1024/768/?random---This is an array, you can set multiple urls, only the first url will be used. These images is also used in Twitter Cards and the Open Graph metadata.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <title>(Hu)go Template Primer</title>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description>
